Collaborative Wiki 3 - Programming Language Deep Dive

Purpose: To practice and demonstrate proficiency in analyzing the details around a specific programming language.

Skills Used: Research, Writing, Communication, Comprehension

Knowledge Goals: Dependent on the question chosen




Summary

In this assignment, you will use Github to collaboratively work on a Wiki around the details, semantics, syntax, lexicon and components of a programming language of your team's choice from a list. You are expected to use proper version control procedures for interacting with the repo that will contain your Wiki. You are required to use Git and Github for this project in a way that showcases that individual contributions of each team member.

The process should be that your team will choose a programming language to research and then divide up the topics to report on for that language. It can be the same programming language you chose from Collaborative Wiki 1 or a new one. Your file you write in Markdown language (a file that has the .md extension) of which there is a tutorial on this here. The practice with markdown will be helpful for you in your future. 

You will probably encounter merge conflicts as you are working on this. Please handle these accordingly. This assignment is not only about learning the concepts in Programming Languages but also to get practice with using Githhub and version control.




Step 1: Pick your programming language

The programming languages you can choose from are below. I am not restricting it but I strongly encourage you to choose a language you know very little about, so avoid Java and Python.

C
C++
C#
C Languages
Java
Python
Rust
PHP
Ruby
F#
R
Kotlin
COBOL
FORTRAN
LISP
ALGOL (any version)
BASIC
PL/I
Any other language of your choice, but you must get approval from the instructor first.




Step 2: Topics

The following are a selection of topics to cover about your programming language. Unlike the brainstorming topics from Collaborative Wiki 1, these topics are each required. A corresponding chapter in the text can serve as a guide to get you started.

Data Types (Chapter 6)
Expressions (Chapter 7)
Assignment Statements (Chapter 7)
Statement-Level Control Structures (Chapter 8)
Subprograms (Chapter 9 and 10)
Abstract Data Types and Encapsulation Concepts (if there are any) (Chapter 11)
Object-Oriented Programming (Chapter 12)
Exception Handling and Event Handling (Chapter 14)




Step 3: Write a simple program in your chosen language

Write a simple program in your chosen language and include it as a code block in your markdown file. Ensure that all topics listed above are represented in your program.




Please use the following link to access the Github Repo:

You are required to fork the repo to your own Github and then clone it to your machine. Work on it and then you can push up your version and create a Pull Request.

If you wish to work on this in Google Documents or Word Online, you are free to do so. Once a person has completed their portion of the document, they would create a branch, add it to the master md file in the repo for the group, stage it (add), create a commit and push it up to Github repo and create a PR.

Why do we have to do this process when we could just create it in Word Online and it would save us so much time? 

- Thats a great question. The reason is because it is our desire for you to understand Git and Github in a way that really sets you apart when you are interviewing for your internships. For that reason, practice with these is part of our everyday work.




Format Requirements
Your submission has to have a minimum of 1000 words. The words in your program do not count towards this amount.
Including images, diagrams and visuals are encouraged and impressive.
Please use proper grammar and spelling at all times. 
Citations are not necessary but encouraged. If used, please use IEEE style.




Assessment

This is a group grade. If anyone is not pulling their weight, please discuss with them during a team meet and if that does not work, then discuss with the professor for further action. See the rubric for details on grading. Performance Reviews are not required currently for Collab Wikis but if it is found team members are not pulling their weight, it can be added.




Deliverables
Completion in Github. Any commits made after due date will be considered to follow the late penalty. Submit a link to the Github repo here.
